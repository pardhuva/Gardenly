Depending on your preference and the time you could be willing to put into growing vegetables, here's a list of some great summer vegetables to grow!</p>
            
            
            <h1 class="right-heading"> Top Summer Vegetables to Grow in your Kitchen Garden</h1>

            <p>A tomato plant with a bunch of red tomatoes on both sides of the main stem makes a lovely sight. Tomato plants love the clear sky and plenty of sunshine.

            <h1>2. Brinjal</h1>
            <!-- Centered Image -->
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../public/images/blogs/f2.webp" alt="Beautiful Indoor Plants">
            </div>
              
            <p>Also known as the Eggplant, this is a warm-season crop that is rather susceptible to frost. It is often said that the consumption of brinjal in summer safeguards children against measles.</p>

            <h1>3.Chili</h1>
            <!-- Centered Image -->
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../public/images/blogs/plant3.webp" alt="Beautiful Indoor Plants">
            </div>
              
            <p>Looking to grow a spice in your vegetable garden? Chili as a spice is very popular in India and some of the most pungent varieties of chilies are grown in the hot summer season.</p>
            <p>The non-pungent varieties are delicate and susceptible to diseases but the pungent ones are hardier. Growing chili with seeds is how the growing process begins!</p>
            

            <h1>4.Pumpkin</h1>
            <!-- Centered Image -->
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../public/images/blogs/f4.webp" alt="Beautiful Indoor Plants">
            </div>
              
            <p> Pumpkins are cucurbit summer vegetables that grow very well during hot seasons. The size of a pumpkin may vary from 5 kg to 40 kg. Because of the size of the fruit, pumpkin climber is allowed to creep on the ground rather than on a trellis. </p>
