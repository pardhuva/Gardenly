            <p>Bees are nature’s little pollinators, vital in keeping our ecosystems thriving. But we get it, we understand—while they are essential for the environment, not everyone wants a buzzing entourage in their garden, especially those with allergies, kids, or simply a desire for a sting-free outdoor space.</p>
            <p>The good news is that nature itself has a solution! Look around and you will find that nature offers natural bee-repellent plants that keep the bees - and even wasps - at bay without harming these hardworking insects! </p>

            <h1>3.Marigolds</h1>
            <!-- Centered Image -->
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../public/images/blogs/plant3.webp" alt="Beautiful Indoor Plants">
            </div>

            <p>Insanely easy to grow from seeds and a wonderful garden addition (plus an absolutely wonderful companion plant), marigolds just don't know how to let you down!</p>

            <h1>4.Lemongrass</h1>
            <!-- Centered Image -->
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="../../public/images/blogs/plant4.webp" alt="Beautiful Indoor Plants">
            </div>
              
            <p> Lemongrass is actually a popular and super effective mosquito-repellent. But it's also an excellent wasp and bee-repelling plant! </p>

            </div>
              
            <p> Non-flowering plants are an excellent way to effortlessly reduce the number of bees and other pollinators that visit your gardens. </p>
            <p>Since ferns are non-flowering, they do not produce any pollen, meaning bees are not naturally attracted to them as a food source. These stunning plants are just not "it" for pollinators!</p>
